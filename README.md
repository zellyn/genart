# Generative Art Experiments

(Algorithmic art, not generative AI models.)

## Bootstrap

This repo uses [hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/), so it
should install the right versions of things automatically. Let me know
if anything doesn't work.

```
git clone https://github.com/zellyn/genart
cd genart
. ./bin/activate-hermit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects

### [Schotter](./schotter)

Experiments related to Georg Nees' "Schotter" ("Gravel") aka "Cubic
Disarray".
